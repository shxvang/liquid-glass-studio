[English](README.md) | [ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá](README-zh.md)

The Ultimate Web Recreation of Apple‚Äôs Liquid Glass UI, powered by WebGL2 and shaders. Includes most Liquid Glass features with fine-grained controls for detailed customization.

## Sheeshmahal: 3D Shadcn Extensions

Alongside the playground we now ship **Sheeshmahal** ‚Äì a monorepo that translates Shadcn/UI components into fully volumetric, glassmorphic counterparts rendered in React Three Fiber.

### Quickstart

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open the developer playground and explore the new `packages/` directory to inspect the reusable Sheeshmahal packages. The fastest path is the Next.js integration example under `examples/next-app`.

### Packages Overview

- `packages/core`: Material and animation primitives shared across runtimes.
- `packages/react`: React bindings, `<SMCanvasProvider>`, and 3D component implementations (`SMButton3D`, `SMCard3D`, `SMModal3D`).
- `packages/presets`: Glass themes and animation preset exports.
- All React components reuse the Liquid Glass Studio multipass shader, so the refraction and glare you tweak in the playground appear identically inside Sheeshmahal scenes.

### Documentation

- [`docs/GETTING_STARTED.md`](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md) ‚Äì installation guide and usage snippets.
- [`docs/DESIGN_GUIDELINES.md`](docs/DESIGN_GUIDELINES.md) ‚Äì glassmorphism palette, motion rules, accessibility notes.
- [`docs/COMPONENT_MAP.md`](docs/COMPONENT_MAP.md) ‚Äì snapshot of Shadcn/UI to Sheeshmahal mappings.
